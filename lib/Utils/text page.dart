        "ans":
            "Generally, a B1 visa is for business (though not working in the U.S.!) and a B2 visa is for tourism or medical treatment. In practice, visa officers almost always issue a combined B1/B2 visa that permits either purpose of travel. Even if you only have one of the purposes of travel, you can still apply for the B1/B2. Visa officers tend not to place significance on whether you put B1, B2, or B1/B2 on the DS-160 because people always get it wrong."

        "ans":
            "There is no regulation on this, but officers are always looking for stories that make sense. For example, one applicant might have just enough money in their bank account to pay for a trip to the U.S., but they have a low paying job, and have never traveled internationally. It doesn't make sense that they would spend their life savings on a vacation to the U.S. without a compelling reason. However, another applicant might have no money in their bank account, but they tell a convincing story of how their mother wants to give them a trip to New York for their college graduation. Assuming the mother's source of income is credible, this story makes sense. The more money in your bank account, the less likely it is that you will work in the U.S. on B status, and the more likely it is that you will be approved."

            "This is one of the few opportunities to write whatever you want on your application, so make it count! Officers don't care about the minute details of your job duties (although they may ask you questions about this to test if you are lying). They want to quicklyunderstand what you do and what your level is in the organization. If your job is highly technical, try to dumb it down a bit as if you were explaining it to your grandmother. If you supervise people or a large budget, mention that to indicate your seniority in the organization. Keep it short! The officer will want to understand what you do after reading for two seconds."

        "ans":
            "Officers are always looking for stories that make sense. If you have a job but are planning to stay in the U.S. more than a few weeks, the officer is going to want an explanation for why your employer will let you leave your job for so long. Also, hotels and restaurants add up and the financial story needs to make sense."

            "It all depends on who it is and what their motivation is. It's common for applicants to ask around their extended family for the person with the biggest bank statement, but when the officer asks why third-cousin Larry is willing to spend \$5,000 on you to go to Disneyland, the applicant is unable to explain. If the sponsor is a close family member or romantic partner, that story would make more sense. If the sponsor is in the U.S., that could be seen as weakening your ties. Again, financial solvency is a very strong tie, so it's very helpful if you have the money to pay for your trip, but not obligatory."

        "ans":
            "I recommend it. The DS-160 doesn't ask for their names so you're just clicking 'yes'. If the visa officer asks you if you have family in the U.S.()very common!), you might say 'no' but you will be thinking about your uncle and the officer will see that in your face and hear the hesitation in your voice. They will then think you lied on your DS-160 to hide U.S.-based immediate family, and may refuse your case."

        "ans":
            "It really depends on how it fits into the overall profile. I think officers usually don't pay attention to hotels, but if it's a person, then it represents a possible tie to the US (and reason not to depart). If that person has violated immigration law, red flag. If that person is immediate family or a romantic partner, red flag. If it's a distant relative who immigrated legally or an American citizen friend, then it's nat such a big deal. Business contacts can look good as long as it doesn't provide an opportunity for the applicant to work."

Examples of common ties are having a good job, having a home or property, having a family member who needs your care, or being far along in an educational program that you would likely want to finish. There are also many less common ties such as having pets, being a member of a religious order, or having a prestigious position in the community.

            "I recommend going into the interview with bullet points that you would like to raise (but not full-paragraph, memorized answers). Visa officers tend to ask questions about ties, so you should have opportunities to share them, but you can also slip them in when answering related questions. For example, if the officer asks 'What is your job?', you could answer 'I own a hardware store, and I am the president of my local Rotary club'. If asked 'are you married?', joke that you are only married to your dog. You can also place a document that signals ties (such as a house deed or university diploma) on the top of your stack of documents - the officer will probably notice it."

This is a subjective decision and could be affected by tiredness or hunger. I heard officers say that their visa refusals were higher when they had low blood sugar, so I guess you could try and time your appointment to take place after a meal.'

Some consulates have illicit vendors in the parking lot who will get you any document you want in a matter of minutes. This is why it's much more important that your story makes sense, sounds authentic, and holds up under scrutiny. That being said, my recommendation for documents is "bring everything you can think of, but don't be surprised when no one asks for it". The thing is, there is no downside to bringing a document that is never asked for, and there is always a chance that the officer will want to see it.'''

However, I hear of B1/B2 applicants having a financial sponsor fill out the 1-864 Affidavit of Support. This document is meant for immigrant visa applications and I don't think officers would put much faith in it for a B visa application. I also hear of applicants notarizing their documents, which again, is not necessary for a B interview. Visa officers don't usually want to see hotel reservations or plane tickets."

However, if you have a document that you believe is very relevant to your case or the question being asked and you think it would help the visa officer understand better than your verbal answer, you can offer it by saying "I have an (x document) if you'd like to see it...". You can also place the document that best supports your case right on top of the stack of documents you place on the table in front of you. Even if the visa officer doesn't ask for it, they will probably notice it and take it into account.'''

It's an important occasion so it is appropriate to dress up a little. I think it makes sense to wear what you would wear if you were meeting your friends at a nice cafe. That being said, sometimes applicants dress very casually and that can be a mark of confidence. It indicates that this is just another day for them and they have no doubt they will be approved. Financial strength is an important "tie" so officers do look at your clothing, hair, and accessories for indicators of wealth. This could be a watch, branded clothing, expensive looking highlights, car keys, a credit card, etc.'''

        "ans":
            '''Visa Officers usually have to conduct 120 interviews before lunch. Because of this, they are in a hurry and impatient. They are regularly checking a report that shows their total number of interviews that day compared to all the other visa officers. If they are behind, they will feel pressure to go faster. This means they don't have time for greetings (or for your very long answers!). If they interrupt you while speaking, you shouldn't take it personally. It means they have the information they need and want to move on to something else. If interrupted, you can just stop talking and listen to the next question. Visa Officers don't make a lot of eye contact because they have to simultaneously read your application and type case notes while talking to you. They will usually look at you as you approach the window to observe your clothing, whether you're sweating, and your body language. Another thing to keep in mind is that all U.S. diplomats must complete a consular tour early in their career. Thereare some officers who are only interested in international relations and view their time doing visa interviews as a chore. '''

            "Check with your local consulate to see what their policy is on this. Some may want to limit the number of people in the waiting room - especially in the time of Covid and not let you bring them. If it is allowed, it can be beneficial to your case to have your children with you. It helps ease officer doubts about child smuggling (because they can observe you interacting naturally as a family). Also, it's harder for visa officers to deny a child's visa to his/her face. One caveat: if your child should normally be in school at that time, the visa officer may wonder why you took them out of school if it isn't a requirement and think that you just did it to improve your chances."

Officers become "satisfied" when you demonstrate strong ties to your home country that would compel you to return, or through authentic, convincing answers given during the interview.'''

If they deny you, they are required to inform you in writing. There are many sections of law under which a visa officer might find you ineligible. Some are rare, such as for having committed a crime or having overstayed your permitted time on a previous trip to the U.S. The most common reasons for refusal are called "214b" and "221g".'''

            '''Yes. Being "satisfied" that a visa applicant is eligible for a visa is a subjective decision and people naturally have different standards. That being said, visa section supervisors try to bring the approval rates of the visa officers as closely in line as possible by discussing borderline cases with officers and working to gain consensus on how that kind of case might be decided. Officers also naturally bring their rates in line because they can see the approval rate of every other officer in the consulate. If they see that their approval rate, over time, is out of line with their colleagues, they may consciously or unconsciously adjust it.'''

        "ans":
            '''Yes. In most countries, it's much more common for younger people to overstay their visa or work unlawfully in the U.S. For this reason, officers feel more confident issuing visas to older people. Also, older people have had more time to establish ties in their home country (family, property, career, etc.). That being said, officers do want to know in what countries their older applicants' adult children live to get an idea on where that applicant might want to live.'''

        "ans":
            '''There is a careful balance here. Visa officers are impatient and don't want to spend more than a couple minutes on your case, so answers shouldn't be much longer than 10 seconds. Otherwise, officers will interrupt you. However, visa officers are searching for "moments of authenticity" when they can sense that you are being open and speaking from the heart (rather than reciting memorized answers). If you only answer questions 'yes' or 'no', or with just one word, officers won't be able to sense authenticity and may become frustrated. The key is to pack a lot of information into those ten seconds. If you have an unusual situation that you need to explain, make sure you use a signaling phrase ("well, here's the deal...", "well, that's a funny story...", "well, the truth is...") to alert the officer that you will be speaking for a while. This will wake them from their interviewing trance and make them actually listen to you.'''

            '''Being registered/having a license does make your business seem more established and something that an applicant would be less likely to abandon to move to the U.S. I also know of some officers who thought evading taxes demonstrated a pattern of violating the law (which might include immigration law in the future). Others did not take this view. As with everything, officers usually rely more on your interview rather than documents, so be prepared to explain your business in minute detail. Also, be aware that a freelance worker whose clients are mostly in the United States may have limits on the activities they can undertake on a B visa. For example, meeting US-based clients could be considered "working", depending on the circumstances. With small businesses, it's difficult for officers to judge how large the operation is, so listing the number of your employees, years in business, or revenue can be helpful.'''

        "ans":
            '''There isn't really a good mechanism for this. You could try emailing the consular section at the relevant embassy. Some of them have "business facilitation programs" that might take notice (especially if there will be a group of applicants applying) and alert the visa officers that applicants may be coming to attend X conference and the conference has been verified (though not necessarily the applicants). If it's just one applicant and not a well-known company, it's unlikely that anyone will take notice. If the meetings or conference would have a strong impact on the U.S. economy, you could try emailing the Economic or Commercial Services section of the Embassy. They in tum might email their colleagues in the consular section and people would take more note because it's an internal email. Mostly, however, there is a firewall between outside entities and the interviewing officer. The only really helpful method is if the applicant has a contact in the U.S. embassy.

In medium or large sections, I don't see this working unless a visa officer makes a serious error in denying a visa or there is some\nemergency medical situation affecting a U.S. citizen. That might get the attention of management. The only effective option for a U.S. citizen to lobby on behalf of a visa applicant would be to contact the Constituent Services office of one of their congressional representatives and ask them to intercede. Many times the U.S. citizen can write a short paragraph that the congressional office will pass directly to the consular section at the Embassy.

        "ans":
            '''With wait times high around the world due to the pandemic, each embassy or consulate should have posted a list of criteria that qualify an applicant for an expedited appointment. The most common are medical emergencies, deaths, students who have an imminent program start date, and business meetings with a large economic impact. The key is to write a short, powerful justification that speaks directly to the criteria you qualify for. For example, if your embassy allows expedited appointments for business meetings, make sure you add information about the size of the project being discussed, its effect on the U.S. economy, how it was unpredictable, why it can only occur in person, and why it has to be you who goes from your company. Attach supporting documentation. Visa sections try to stick closely to the set criteria so that they can be fair to everyone and to keep multiple request approvers on the same page, but I used to approve these and there are always situations that the consulate can't plan for and aren't included in the criteria. These can get approved just because they "feel" urgent (e.g. a country is sending its first female delegate to a robotics competition and it's getting a lot of media attention).

Unless you're a good actor, don't memorize long answers beforehand. They sound fake. Also, it's unlikely the officer will ask you the exact question you were expecting, so when you launch off on your unrelated spiel, it looks bad. When preparing what to say, just make a few bullet points so that your answers at the interview will sound like you're saying them for the first time.

        "ans":
            '''The officer may be rude and won't look at you try to take that in stride, it's not personal. Place your most powerful document on the top of the pile. The sound systems can be poor quality, so if you can't hear the question, ask clearly and politely "could you please repeat that? The speaker is buzzing". Americans are very casual, it's perfectly fine to talk to the officer like you would talk to a friend. At the end of the interview, if the officer starts refusing you, you can take one more chance to really speak from the heart. Say "excuse me, can I say one more thing?". The officer will mostly say yes. Try to give one last heartfelt explanation that you are a legitimate tourist. The key here is emotional connection with the officer so they can sense from your voice whether you're telling the truth. Applicants who did this changed my mind a few times. Also, there's no downside because they were going to refuse you anyway. If you speak english well, try doing your interview in english - it shows you're educated. There really is no "perfect answer", it's about authenticity, so even if you say something that appears bad - it will make the officer trust you. For example, if they ask "what's your job", it's ok to say "Well, actually, I just quit. I hated my boss. I'm lining up some interviews at other consulting companies, but this seems like the perfect time to go see Yellowstone before I start a new job." I like that better than saying in a rehearsed way "My previous career ceased to challenge me so I left and since then I have been taking online courses to improve my resume profile."'''

If you've already made a short visit to another country that has a developed economy, it shows that you had the opportunity to work overseas and you didn't take it.. This gives the officer confidence that you won't work in the U.S. either. Travel to countries that don't have developed economies doesn't help your case as much, though it does demonstrate a history of interest in international travel. If someone wants to visit Disneyland but has never even visited a neighboring country, it can seem strange. Long periods of time spent in other countries could indicate a pattern of emigrating for work and hurt your case.'''

However, if your family member has demonstrated a history of abiding by U.S. immigration law, or has a job/visa that indicates your family values education, they can actually be a plus point for you, especially if you have other strong ties to your home country.

It happens with some frequency that the second officer will come to a different decision than the first officer. In theory, the second officer should have some new information that the first officer didn't know in order to come to a different decision (this is why they often ask different questions than the first officer asked). Impatient officers sometimes just ask "what have you changed since your last interview". This is a trick question and you usually shouldn't answer "nothing" because the officer will then conclude that the first officer's decision was correct and will quickly refuse you so that they can move on to their next interview quickly. If asked this question, I recommend answering "Last time, I wasn't able to explain that..." and then give some information about a compelling tie you have to your home country that didn't come up in the previous interview. I think it also happens that the first officer might have a reputation for being overly strict and the second officer may approve the case because of that.'''

Romantic partners usually want to live in the same place, so if the partner is living in the U.S. the officer will assume that you wish to establish residency in the United States with him/her in violation of your B visa. There are two ways to help the officer overcome this doubt. Either the romantic partner is already residing or will soon reside outside of the United States, OR, your trip to the United States is temporary and you have credible plans for departing the United States, filing the appropriate immigrant visa petition, and then reentering the United States with an immigrant visa to permanently join your partner.approved.

That being said, having a pending immigrant petition does affect your B1/B2 case, depending on the relationship, your awareness of the petition, how much family you have in the U.S., and how long the waiting period is for your immigrant petition to become current.'''

If you keep changing your purpose of travel, the officer will think that you are just trying to get to the US by any means possible. The only thing you can do is try to supply new information about your ties overseas that may not have come up the first time. Sometimes, just the fact that you reapply even with the same profile and no new information signals that you are a serious applicant and the second officer may give you another look.
